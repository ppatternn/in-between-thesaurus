                Welcome to <strong>In Between Thesaurus</strong>! Enter multiple words separated by spaces to discover their synonyms. 
                Each word you input is highlighted with a unique color. Synonyms are displayed as clickable tiles colored to match their respective words.
                If a synonym is shared among multiple words, its tile will feature a split color background indicating its association.
